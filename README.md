JSON Adapter for ABAP Function Modules
======================================

Welcome to the JSON adapter for ABAP Function Modules!! (or adaptor)

This adapter was first published in SAP SCN blog (http://scn.sap.com/community/abap/connectivity/blog/2013/03/05/json-adapter-for-abap-function-modules). The blog remains its main reference and discussion place.

This adapter is specific to SAP ABAP systems. It should work on any SAP release from 7.0 onwards, however some slight modifications may be needed for older SP levels. 

The purpose of this adaptor is to allow calling ABAP function modules via HTTP and serializing the input and output in JSON format. This allows a very simple way to invoke ABAP functionality from HTML5 and AJAX or Jquery based applications.
